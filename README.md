# Pokemon Trainer VS Seeker

The VS Seeker is an application with the primary function of allowing a Pokemon Trainer (henceforth "user") to register and reference rivals battled through a user's adventure. Though this is its primary function, the VS Seeker can also be used simply as a way to log and record trainers, or as a way for the user to keep track of their own progress. The VS Seeker allows the user to choose from a list of its registered trainers, offering them a selection of options for both the trainers and their known Pokemon.

## Initialization

When the VS Seeker is booted, the user is met with the simple options of viewing its registered trainers or shutting down the application. As the user progresses through their options they are given additional selections and access to additional features.

## Features

* User may view a list of all trainers they have registered to the VS Seeker.
* When viewing all registered trainers, the user may see additional details on any individual trainer, as well as register a new trainer to the VS Seeker.
* The user can update registered trainers' information including their name, badges, and Pokemon possessed. Additionally the user can remove the trainer from the VS Seeker.
* In addition to being able to register trainers, the user can create entries for new Pokemon a trainer possesses, as well as viewing the details of an individual Pokemon.
* Pokemon details can be updated by the user when viewing them, addressing increased level, new evolution, and other information.
* Simple menu navigation allows the user to return to their previous menus at any time or shut down the VS Seeker with ease.
